# ultimate-tic-tac-toe

After implementing the UCT algorithm in a class of mine for reversi (see reversi-uct-project repository), I wanted to apply it to other games. I settled on Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, as I always found the game enjoyable and figured it wouldn't be too complicated to code from scratch (or at least from the rough outline from my reversi project). The resulting game and automated players are in this repository. A solid explanation of the rules of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe can be found [here](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/).
